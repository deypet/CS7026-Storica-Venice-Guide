                <h2>A Fortress of Political Might</h2>
                <p>
                    The Doge’s Palace (Palazzo Ducale) is the embodiment of Venice’s power, both political and economic.
                    The stunning architecture reflects the wealth and influence the Venetian Republic once commanded across the Mediterranean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For centuries, it was the seat of the Doge, the elected ruler of Venice, and the home of the Venetian government.
                    The Doge, who was chosen by an electoral system, held immense power, but was also constrained by the many councils that governed the Republic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also housed the council chambers, the court of justice, and even the prisons for those who opposed the Republic.
                    These prisons were located in the lower floors of the palace.
                </p>

                <h3>Casanova's Great Escape (1756)</h3>
                <p>
                    The legendary seducer Giacomo Casanova was imprisoned in the attic-like Piombi prison, but he escaped by digging through the floor with a metal spike!
                </p>
                <h3>The Bridge of Sighs</h3>
                <p>
                    Prisoners took their last look at Venice through its windows before their fate was sealed. Some say you can still hear their sighs if you listen carefully at dusk.
                    The bridge’s name is said to come from the mournful sighs of the prisoners as they crossed it on their way to the prison, knowing they will never leave.
                </p>
                <h3>The Ghosts of the Doge's Palace</h3>
                <p>
                    Some believe that the Doge’s Palace is haunted by the spirits of prisoners who never made it out.
